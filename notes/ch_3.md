# Memory

## 3.1 Memory Devices
- Fundamentally we need to have a wayt o maintain state. 
- the first gae we're building is called a data flip-flop or a DFF. Basically, we need to be able to keep track of time.

## 3.2 Sequential Logic

### 3.2.1 Time Matters
So we have cycles that occur

DFF &rarr; 1 bit register &rarr; 16 bits &rarr; right RAM 
### 3.2.2 Flip-Flops

### 3.2.3 Combination and Sequential Logic

## 3.3 Specifications

### 3.3.1 Data Flip-Flop

### 3.3.2 Registers

### 3.3.3 Random Access Memory

### 3.3.4 Counter

## 3.4 Implementation 

## Glossary

### store values over time
- Basically how can you persist a value
### combinational chips
- refer to a separate set of chips without delay
### sequential chips
- depend on previously computed inputs (time dependent)
### current
