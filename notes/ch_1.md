# Chapter 1

## Session 1
### Goals:
- Boolean Algebra
- Binary Arithmetic
- General understanding of where we're going
- Nand Chip
- Converting boolean algebra into chips
- Write first lines of code
- Write out the 

### Basic Boolean Algebra
- What is true, false
- What are the operators
- What is a truth table
- what is a venn diagram


### Binary
- How do you write in base 10?
- how do you write in base n?


### HW Set 1:
1. Write out and draw the truth tables and Venn Diagrams of all of the Logical operators on page 11
2. Write the following numbers in base 10, base 2 and base 3
  *  50
  *  100
  *  9
  *  40
  *  30
  *  5000
3. Try opening the software package on your computer
  * Nand2tetris.org, windows instructions.
4. [Change of Basis](https://github.com/rakirs2/General-Notes/blob/main/ChangeOfBases.md)

## Session 2:
### goals
- see hw progress
- what you liked/didn't like
- Seeing if we can get your computer working
- "cheating policy"
- Get computer set up
- "going ahead" policy
- text editor
- going over hdl/looking at glossary
- What we're doing

### HW Set 2
- all chips (self limit your time spent)
- Go [here](https://github.com/rakirs2/Nand2Tetris/edit/main/notes/ch_1.md) and tell me what you've covered
- Decide if you want to create a github like the one this site is hosted on


## Session 3

## Goals
- Get laptop setup
- Look over HW
- Setup what the class is about/demystify some things
- Understand how to run and test code
- Shell Basics

### HW
- Go over any mistakes (don't think there were any I could spot)
- Make sure you have the following truth tables/Venn Diagrams memorized
 - Nand, And, Nor, Or, Xor
 - Try implementing them in HDL and the tester
- [shell basics](https://github.com/rakirs2/General-Notes/blob/main/ShellBasics.md)
- Install this [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=roblourens.vscode-nand2tetris-hdl) in vscode 
- Figure out what winget is and decided if you want to use it to install Microsoft.Powertoys (I use windows + space) a lot
- Decide if you want to 'supplement' the programming stuff
- Look at A3.1, A3.2 (These are the "how to run all of the code on the termina")


## Resources If stuck
- Appendices:
 - Boolean function synthesis
 - Hardware Description language(A2.2)
