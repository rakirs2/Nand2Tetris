# Chapter 1

## Goals:
- Boolean Algebra
- Binary Arithmetic
- General understanding of where we're going
- Nand Chip
- Converting boolean algebra into chips
- Write first lines of code
- Write out the 

## Basic Boolean Algebra
- What is true, false
- What are the operators
- What is a truth table
- what is a venn diagram


## Binary
- How do you write in base 10?
- how do you write in base n?


### HW Set 1:
1. Write out and draw the truth tables and Venn Diagrams of all of the Logical operators on page 11
2. Write the following numbers in base 10, base 2 and base 3
  *  50
  *  100
  *  9
  *  40
  *  30
  *  5000
3. Try opening the software package on your computer
  * Nand2tetris.org, windows instructions.

## Lesson 2:
## goals
- see hw progress
- what you liked/didn't like
- Seeing if we can get your computer working
- "cheating policy"
- Get computer set up
- "going ahead" policy
- text editor
- going over hdl/looking at glossary
- What we're doing

### HW Set 2
- all chips (self limit your time spent)
- Go [here](https://github.com/rakirs2/Nand2Tetris/edit/main/notes/ch_1.md) and tell me what you've covered
- Decide if you want to create a github like the one this site is hosted on
