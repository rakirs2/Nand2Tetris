# Chapter 1

## Goals:
- Learn basic boolean algebra
- understand that everthing is boolean math underneath the hood
- Understand HDL language/setup
- Implement all of the gates listed in the chapter

## 1.1 Boolean Algebra
In common parlance, we say something is either true or false. This is represented as a "boolean." This true or false relationship is the fundamental building block of all of computer science.

We represent 'true' and 'false' as 1 and 0 respectively. 

### Boolean Operators
While we have boolean values, we need to be able to do more than just have values. We need to be able to do things with them. We call such 'functions' operators.

The basic functions are called 'and', 'or' and 'not'.

These are represented in different ways. Two viable sets of notation are shown below:

| Operator | Book Notation   | How I learned it   |
|----------|-----------------|--------------------|
| And      | $$ x \cdot y $$ | $$ x \land y $$ |
| Or       | $$ x + y $$ |          $$ x \lor y $$          |
| Not      |  $$ \overline{x}$$               |      $$ \lnot x$$               |
